# Time Complexity Analysis and Graphical Representation

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to gain an understanding of time complexity analysis for algorithms and practice representing them graphically. Time complexity analysis is crucial in determining the efficiency of algorithms, and graphical representations provide visual insights into how an algorithm's performance scales with the input size.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will:

1. Analyze and determine the time complexity of algorithms.
2. Create graphical representations of the analyzed time complexities.
3. Present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Analyzing Time Complexities

- Analyze the time complexity of algorithms provided or chosen by the instructor.
- Determine the Big O notation for the algorithms in terms of input size.

### Task 2: Graphical Representation

- Use appropriate tools or libraries to create graphical representations of the analyzed time complexities.
- Represent the time complexities in graphical forms such as line graphs, bar charts, or scatter plots.

### Task 3: Documentation

- Document your analysis process and methodology used for determining time complexities.
- Provide explanations for the graphical representations, highlighting key insights.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your assignment through the designated platform or repository provided by the instructor.
- Ensure that your submission includes:
  - Analysis of time complexities.
  - Graphical representations.
  - Documentation of your process and findings.
